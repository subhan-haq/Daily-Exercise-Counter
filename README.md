# Daily-Exercise-Counter
A Scrimba inspired project. The program keeps track of how many days in a row somebody has exercised. Through buttons that call JavaScript functions the program increments or resets the counter. Through the usage of localstorage and onload the program is also able to store and display the correct counter as soon as the program is loaded.
